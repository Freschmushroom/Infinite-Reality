# CHANGELOG
# DATE (DD|MM|YY): 13 09 13

+ Added system to save IRTUs.
+ Included a debugging tool (NVWA - http://wyw.dcweb.cn/leakage.htm) to detect memory leaks.
+ Added support for floats and doubles.

~ Fixed several memory leaks.

! Lists are yet to be implemented.
! Doubles are saved as two integers; float as one. Incompatibility on 16 bit system is likely.
